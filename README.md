Open to members of New York University's [Center for Brain Imaging](http://cbi.nyu.edu/), [Center for Neural Science](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/), and [Department of Psychology](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/psychology.html) on the Meyer network.

Tested to run on GNU/Linux ([Debian-based OSs](https://www.debian.org/derivatives/#list)) and currently-supported versions of macOS.

## EZ Install

**macOS:** `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marshki/matlab_installer/master/src/macOS/macOS_installer.sh | caffeinate sudo bash`

**GNU/LINUX (Debian-based distros):**
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marshki/matlab_installer/master/src/linux/linux_installer.sh && sudo bash linux_installer.sh`

## Getting Started

**For sysadmins who want to replicate this process**, we assume the following of you:

- [ ] are affiliated with an institution that has a valid `Total Academic Headcount License` agreement with Math Works

- [ ] may access a network license server to validate local MATLAB installs

- [ ] can access a networked file server

- [ ] deployed MATLAB locally on a `macOS` and/or `GNU/Linux` client

On your local client, tar up the MATLAB install with, e.g.:

`tar czf matlab9.5.tgz matlab9.5`

and place the file on your web server for distribution.

If needed, modify the installer script(s) to reflect your institution's environment.

**For sysadmins** AND **end users**:

__Pre-flight checklist__ (the script will check for the following conditions):

- [ ] root privileges

- [ ] adequate free disk space (30 GBs)

- [ ] [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) or [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

- [ ]  access to the the appropriate local network

**_NOTE:_** If you want the TUI version, you'll need to add the `dialog` package via [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) with:

`apt-get install --yes dialog` prior to executing the script.

__Liftoff:__

Grab the script for your OS from `/src` in this repository, then, with elevated privileges, call the script (*[caffeinate](https://ss64.com/osx/caffeinate.html) will prevent macOS from going to sleep during the installation)*:

* `sudo bash linux_installer.sh (Linux)`, or: `caffeinate -i sudo bash macOS_installer.sh` (macOS) to auto-install the most recent version of Matlab.

* `caffeinate -i sudo bash macOS_multi_installer.sh` (macOS) will launch a text-based menu. From there, follow on-screen prompts:

* `bash linux_installer_tui.sh` (Linux) will launch a text-based user interface and do the driving for you:
